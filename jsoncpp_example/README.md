From the directory containing this README, run

```
g++ -o main -std=c++11 main.cpp jsoncpp.cpp
```

to compile the code.

This will create an executable called main which you can run with

```
./main
```

The code will read test.json and print the value of the "nested_array" property of the json to STDOUT as an example.
